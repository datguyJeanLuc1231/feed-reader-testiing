# Feed Reader Testing Project
Testing the Feed Reader app using the `JavaScript` testing framework [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/). This was part of the Front-End Web Developer NanoDegree Program from Udacity.

## Run the test locally

* The test will be located on the bottom of the page.

* If you want to check out what types of test I used, just go to the `spec` folder under the `jasmine` folder, and click on the `feedreader.js` file.
